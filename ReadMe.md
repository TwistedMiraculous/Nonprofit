# Women’s Wellness Connect  

## What the Project Is  
Women’s Wellness Connect is a website I built for a nonprofit organization focused on supporting women’s mental health and wellness. The site highlights the nonprofit’s mission, showcases upcoming events and projects, introduces the team, and provides ways for visitors to get involved.  

## Why I Made It  
This was my first real-world project made for someone else. I created it to help my friend launch her nonprofit online and give the organization a professional platform to connect with the community.  

## How I Made It  
- Designed a clear structure with sections like **Home, Meet the Team, Events, Projects, and Get Involved**  
- Hosted and deployed using Firebase Hosting for speed, reliability, and security  
- Focused on making the website user friendly and easy for users to navigate through the website.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned  
- **Challenges:** Translating someone else’s vision into a working website, organizing content effectively, and making everything look polished as a first-time project  
- **What I Learned:**  
  - How to deploy with Firebase  
  - The importance of clear navigation and layout in web design  
  - Communication skills, listening to feedback and adjusting the design to fit the nonprofit’s goals
